## Hi there!
I'm __Simon Robin__ a.k.a. ___sljrobin___. I'm an __Information Security enthusiast__. Besides my passion for __Web Security__, I like to __create programs__. I code mostly in __Python__, but also in __C__ and __Bash__.

## My recent creations
* üéß [__Audious__](https://github.com/sljrobin/Audious): _A virtual assistant for music collections._
* üí∞ [__MonitorMoney__](https://github.com/sljrobin/MonitorMoney): _A monitor to handle private expenses._
* ü©∫ [__RodentSniffer__](https://github.com/sljrobin/RodentSniffer): _A network sniffer for the most common network protocols._
* ‚öôÔ∏è [__.dotfiles__](https://github.com/sljrobin/.dotfiles): _Personal configuration files for Unix/Linux._

## Outdated projects
* üîß [__ConfigThePenguin__](https://github.com/sljrobin/ConfigThePenguin): _Toolbox for automated Arch/Debian installation and configuration._ It was a list of different Bash scripts I was using when setting up a Virtual Machine based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
* üìÑ [__ReporTeX__](https://github.com/sljrobin/ReporTeX): _Automatic LaTeX report generation._ This Python script was shared with other students at the university. The goal was to help us to quickly generate a nice [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for weekly reports.
* ‚è≥ [__listodo__](https://github.com/sljrobin/listodo): _A task lists generator for source code._ One of the first tools I used while coding. Then I switched to [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and managed my TODOs with them.
