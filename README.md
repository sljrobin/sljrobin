## Hi there!
I'm **Simon Robin** a.k.a. ***sljrobin***. I'm an **Information Security enthusiast**. Besides my passion for **Web Security**, I like to **create programs**. Nowadays, I code mostly in **Python**. Before, I used to develop in **C** and **Bash**.

## My recent creations
* üéß [**Audious**](https://github.com/sljrobin/Audious): *A virtual assistant for music collections.*
* üí∞ [**MonitorMoney**](https://github.com/sljrobin/MonitorMoney): *A monitor to handle private expenses.*
* ü©∫ [**RodentSniffer**](https://github.com/sljrobin/RodentSniffer): *A network sniffer to analyse the most common network protocols.*
* üñãÔ∏è [**Website**](https://github.com/sljrobin/Website): *My little corner of the Internet.*
* ‚öôÔ∏è [**.dotfiles**](https://github.com/sljrobin/.dotfiles): *Personal configuration files for Unix/Linux.*

## Outdated projects
* üîß [**ConfigThePenguin**](https://github.com/sljrobin/ConfigThePenguin): *Toolbox for automated Arch/Debian installation and configuration.* It was a list of different Bash scripts I was using when setting up a Virtual Machine based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
* üìÑ [**ReporTeX**](https://github.com/sljrobin/ReporTeX): *Automatic LaTeX report generation.* This Python script was shared with other students at the university. The goal was to help us to quickly generate a nice [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for weekly reports.
* ‚è≥ [**listodo**](https://github.com/sljrobin/listodo): *A task lists generator for source code.* One of the first tools I used while coding. Then I switched to [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and managed my TODOs with them.
